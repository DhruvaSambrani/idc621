3. [TermPaper1.jl](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/idc621/blob/main/TermPaper1.jl) - A Pluto notebook which is the final submitted code/paper
4. [CellularBase.html](../CellularBase.html) - A documentation for the module
5. [termpaper1.html](termpaper1.html) - The final static paper to be evaluated
